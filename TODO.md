# Further steps
- Email Verification
- Allow changing password
- Allow unauthenticated users to get a list of public fields of all users (GET list)
- Store Date of Birth instead of Age
- Allow the db to push information to server through a listener so if an admin or some other service updates the db the changes will update the in memory data store
